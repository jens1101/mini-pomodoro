# About
This is a small pomodoro app that I use while developing. This is also a playground for me to mess around with the latest web standards and Github features.

# Features
- A countdown timer that runs for 25min once you hit "Start". Once it finished it will alter the user with a sound and a notification.
- You can stop the countdown at any time by hitting "Stop"
- You can restart the countdown while it is running by hitting the "Start" button again
- You can log distractions. You do this via the provided form.
- You can remove logged distractions via the <code>&times;</code> button on each distraction.

# Requirements
To run this project yourself all you need is a simple HTTP server.
